Dearest Nada,

Nine months ago, you walked into my life, and I had no idea that in such a short time, my entire world would change for the better. Today, as we celebrate two months of being engaged, I find myself looking back at how quickly "me" became "us."

They say when you know, you know, and with you, I knew instantly. These past two months as your fiancé have been the happiest of my life. Walking through the world knowing that I get to spend the rest of my days with you by my side gives me a sense of peace and purpose I never knew existed.

You are so much more to me than just my future wife. You are my home, my greatest comfort, and the person who makes every day feel like a celebration. Your laugh is my favorite sound, and your heart is the most beautiful thing I have ever known.

Thank you for saying "yes" to me. Thank you for these six incredible months of getting to know your soul, and for the two months of planning a future that I know will be more beautiful than I ever dreamed.

I love you more than words can capture, and I can’t wait to call you my wife.

Happy Anniversary, my beautiful Nada♥️♥️♥️.

Yours forever,
Ali
